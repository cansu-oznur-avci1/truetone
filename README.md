## 🌟 Key Features

* **🤖 AI Feedback Normalization:** A built-in AI engine analyzes raw user input in real-time. It automatically reformulates informal or emotional feedback into a professional, polite, and standardized tone before it reaches the service owner.
* **📊 Dynamic Analytics Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard that visualizes feedback trends, user satisfaction metrics, and system performance.
* **🗄️ Robust Database Architecture:** Designed with a complex relational schema to store both raw and AI-normalized data, ensuring data integrity and consistency across the MVT architecture.
* **🔐 Secure Management:** Features a role-based access control (RBAC) system for users, service owners, and administrators.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.x, Django Web Framework
* **AI Layer:** Generative AI for Text Normalization & Tone Adjustment
* **Database:** Relational Schema (SQL-based), Django ORM for optimized querying
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

1. **Normalization Pipeline:** When a user submits feedback, the AI processes the string to normalize the tone while preserving the core intent.
2. **Data Modeling:** The database is optimized to handle relational dependencies between users, service types, and multi-layered feedback entries.
3. **Responsive UI:** Fully compatible with mobile and desktop devices.
